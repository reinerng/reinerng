- 👋 Hi, I’m @reinerng (reiner). 
- 👀 I’m interested in attitudes and persuasion, networks, and sentiment analyses.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python and R, and how to better manage large data for such analyses, to get more insights into the data for better story-telling.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any research related to attitudes and its properties, networks, and sentiment-related works.
- 📫 How to reach me: I am on linkedin https://www.linkedin.com/in/reiner-ng-730717b5/ or find me at www.reinerng.github.io
